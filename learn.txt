			 		The projects which are having more demand in engineering level and especially
			 		very useful for ECE and EEE students. We are all well known that we cannot 
			 		imagine our life without electricity even for single day as it became a
			 		part in our life. So, it is very important and beneficial to us if we 
			 		learn some basic things about electronics.

			This electronics concept deals with various small and large circuits which may
			include concepts like diodes,We found that many people are showing interest to
			learn electronics concepts by joining in various electronics branches like
			ECE, EEE, etc. in engineering. They can get good knowledge on electronics 
			only after doing some major projects or Mini Projects on Electronics in 
			their engineering. For those people, the below list of electronics

		Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications 
		that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter.
		[1] The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the invention of the
		vacuum tube, which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated 
		the field of electronics and the electron age.
	</p>


	<p>
		Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical 
		components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, 
		optoelectronics, and sensors, associated passive electrical components, 
		and interconnection technologies. Commonly, electronic devices contain
		circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors 
		supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an
		electronic circuit.
	</p>

	<p>

		The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control 
		electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible. Electronics 
		is widely used in information processing, telecommunication, and signal
		processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes 
		digital information-processing possible. Interconnection technologies
		such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other
		varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit 
		functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a
		regular working system, called an electronic system; examples
		are computers or control systems. An electronic system may be a 
		component of another engineered system or a standalone device.
	</p>
	<p>

		Electrical and electromechanical science and technology deals with 
		the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of 
		electrical energy to and from other energy forms (using wires, motors,
		generators, batteries, switches, relays, transformers, resistors, and
		other passive components). This distinction started around 1906 with
		the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode, which made electrical
		amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible 
		with a non-mechanical device. Until 1950 this field was called 
		"radio technology" because its principal application was the
		design and theory of radio transmitters, receivers, and vacuum tubes.

        As of 2018 most electronic devices[3] use semiconductor components 
        to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and
        related technology is considered a branch of solid-state physics, 
        whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to 
        solve practical problems come under electronics engineering. 
        This article focuses on engineering aspects of electronics.

		Main article: Electronic component
		An electronic component is any physical entity in an electronic
		system used to affect the electrons or their associated field
		s in a manner consistent with the intended function of the 
		electronic system. Components are generally intended to be 
		connected together, usually by being soldered to a printed
		circuit board (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with 
		a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver,
		or oscillator). Components may be packaged singly, or in more
		complex groups as integrated circuits. Some common electronic
		components are capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes,
		transistors, etc. Components are often categorized as active
		(e.g. transistors and thyristors) or passive 
		(e.g. resistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors).

		<h2>History of electronic components</h2>
	<p>
		Further information: History of electronic engineering and Timeline
		 of electrical and electronic engineering
		Vacuum tubes (Thermionic valves) were among the earliest electronic 
		components.[5] They were almost solely responsible for the
		electronics revolution of the first half of the twentieth century.
		[6][7] They allowed for vastly more complicated systems and gave us 
		radio, television, phonographs, radar, long-distance telephony and
		much more. They played a leading role in the field of microwave and 
		high power transmission as well as television receivers until the 
		middle of the 1980s.[8] Since that time, solid-state devices have
		all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in 
		some specialist applications such as high power RF amplifiers,
		cathode ray tubes, specialist audio equipment, guitar 
		amplifiers and some microwave devices.

		In April 1955, the IBM 608 was the first IBM product to use 
		transistor circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed 
		to be the first all-transistorized calculator to be manufactured
		for the commercial market.[9][10] The 608 contained more than
		3,000 germanium transistors. Thomas J. Watson Jr. ordered all
		 future IBM products to use transistors in their design.
	 	From that time on transistors were almost exclusively
		used for computer logic and peripherals.

		<h2>Types of circuits</h2>
	<p>
		Circuits and components can be divided into two groups:
		analog and digital. A particular device may consist of
		circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.
	</p>
	
		<h2>Analog circuits</h2>

		<h3> Analog electronics</h3>
	<P>
		Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis
		Most analog electronic appliances, such as radio receivers,
		are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic
		circuits. Analog circuits use a continuous range of voltage 
		or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.
	</P>
	<P>
		The number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge,
		especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from
		a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.
	</P>
	<P>
		Analog circuits are sometimes called linear circuits although
		many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as 
		mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include
		vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.
	</P>
	<P>
		One rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog.
		These days analog circuitry may use digital or even
		microprocessor techniques to improve performance.
		This type of circuit is usually called "mixed signal"
		rather than analog or digital.
	</P>
	<P>
		Sometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between
		analog and digital circuits as they have elements of
		both linear and non-linear operation. An example is 
		the comparator which takes in a continuous range of
		voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a
		digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transis
		tor amplifier can take on the characteristics of 
		a controlled switch having essentially two levels
		of output. In fact, many digital circuits are
		actually implemented as variations of analog
		circuits similar to this example – after all, 
		all aspects of the real physical world are essentially
		analog, so digital effects are only realized
		by constraining analog behavior.
	</P>
	
		<h2>Digital circuits</h2>

	<h3> Digital electronics</h3>
	<p>
		Digital circuits are electric circuits based on a number 
		of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most
		common physical representation of Boolean algebra, and 
		are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers,
		the terms "digital circuit", "digital system" and "logic"
		are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits. 
		Most digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage 
		levels labeled "0" and "1". Often logic "0" will be a lower
		voltage and referred to as "Low" while logic "1" is referred
		to as "High". However, some systems use the reverse definition
		("0" is "High") or are current based. Quite often the logic 
		designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit 
		the next as he sees fit to facilitate his design.
		The definition of the levels as "0" or "1" is arbitrary.

	<h2>Heat dissipation and thermal management</h2>
	
	<h3> Thermal management of electronic devices and systems</h3>
			Heat generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent
		immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation 
		is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve
		greater dissipation include heat sinks and fans for air cooling,
		and other forms of computer cooling such as water cooling. These 
		techniques use convection, conduction, and radiation of heat energy.
	</P>
	
	<h2>Noise</h2>
		<h3> Electronic noise</h3>
	<p>
			Electronic noise is defined as unwanted disturbances 
		superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its 
		information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion
		caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic
		circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated,
		which can be decreased by lowering the operating temperature 
		of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as shot noise cannot
		be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.
